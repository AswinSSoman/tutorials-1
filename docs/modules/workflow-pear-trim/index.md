Pear

Trimmomatic

Assembly


## Trimmomatic


Settings:
 trimmed leading and trailing - qual 15
 sliding window 4 - 20

 did for F, R, merged

all - can see file size dropped so some were trimmed

## Spades

 put all these trimmomatic files in as "unpaired/single reads"

## Compare to no pear + trimmomatic + spades



vs Assembly only

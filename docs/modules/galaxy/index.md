# Get Data into Galaxy

Keywords: Galaxy, Microbial Genomics Virtual Lab

## Galaxy Background

Galaxy is a web-based analysis and workflow platform designed for biologists to analyse their own data. It can be used to run a variety of bioinformatics tools. The selection of bioinformatics tools installed on the Galaxy instance we are using today caters for the analysis of bacterial genomics data sets.

Galaxy is an open, web-based platform. Details about the project can be found [here](https://galaxyproject.org/).

The Galaxy interface is separated into three parts. The <ss>Tools</ss> list on the left, the <ss>Viewing</ss> panel in the middle and the analysis and data <ss>History</ss> on the right.

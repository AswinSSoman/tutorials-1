##ABRPI training materials

###Antibiotic Resistant Pathogens Initiative

This site contains tutorials for using the ABRPI
[Microbial Genomics Virtual Lab](http://genome.edu.au/) (the mGVL) to perform bioinformatics
tasks on bacterial "omics" data, either on the Unix command line or using
the [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) system.

Tutorials on Genomics, PacBio assembly, Transcriptomics and Proteomics can be found under the tabs in the top panel.

For more information about how to use the Microbial Genomics Virtual Lab and Galaxy, see <http://www.genome.edu.au/>

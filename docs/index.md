# Welcome!

## ABRPI training materials

### Antibiotic Resistant Pathogens Initiative

This site contains tutorials for using the ABRPI
[Microbial Genomics Virtual Lab](http://genome.edu.au/) (the mGVL) to perform bioinformatics
tasks on bacterial "omics" data, either on the Unix command line or using
the [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) system. Tutorials on Genomics, PacBio assembly, Transcriptomics and Proteomics can be found under the tabs in the top panel.

If you wish to set up your own instance (version) of the mGVL, follow the instructions [here](http://vlsci.github.io/lscc_docs/tutorials/gvl_launch/gvl_launch/). Note: at the stage where you select options in the GVL Launcher window, go to <fn>Show advanced startup options</fn> and under <fn>Flavor</fn> select *Microbial GVL with Tutorial Indices*. In this mGVL instance, you can use both Galaxy and command line tools. If you wish to use the command line tools on a different computer (e.g. your local computer), you would need to make sure the required tools are installed (e.g. Canu, Circlator, Pilon, SPAdes, etc.).

For more information about how to use the Microbial Genomics Virtual Lab and Galaxy, see <http://www.genome.edu.au/>

# Overview

This section contains tutorials for basic microbial genomics analyses in Galaxy. These have been designed to be done sequentially.

1. [Use the Galaxy Platform](galaxy/index.md):
a web-based interface for bioinformatic analyses.

2. [Import tutorial data to Galaxy](data/index.md): a set of files to use in these introductory tutorials.

3. [Quality control of Illumina data](fastqc/index.md):
assess raw Illumina data for quality issues.

4. [Assemble genomes with Spades](spades/index.md):
assemble raw Illumina sequence reads into a draft bacterial genome sequence using the tool "Spades".

5. [Annotate genomes with Prokka](prokka/index.md):
describe the type and location of proteins and other features on the draft bacterial genome sequence using the tool "Prokka".

6. [Find variants with Snippy](snippy/index.md): identify differences (such as nucleotide mutations) between genomes using the tool "Snippy".

<!--
3a. [Read cleaning](fastqc/index.md):
trim and clip your reads of sequencing artifacts
-->
